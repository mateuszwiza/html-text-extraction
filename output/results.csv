GUARANTEE dated as of [  ], among [                    ] and
[                    ] (each, a  Borrowing Subsidiary ) and Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent (the  Administrative
Agent ) for the Lenders and Issuers (as defined in the Credit Agreement referred to below). A. Reference is made to the
Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of July 25, 2014 (as amended from time to time, the  Credit Agreement ), among Alcoa, the Lenders and Issuers party thereto, Citibank, N.A. ( Citi ), as
Administrative Agent for the Lenders and Issuers, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Syndication Agent. B. Capitalized terms used herein
and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Credit Agreement. C. Each Borrowing Subsidiary
will obtain benefits from the incurrence of Loans by the Borrowers pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and accordingly, desires to execute this Subsidiary Guarantee in order to (i) satisfy the requirements described in Section 10.04(f) of
the Credit Agreement and (ii) induce the Lenders to continue to make Loans to the Borrowers pursuant to the Credit Agreement. Accordingly, each Borrowing Subsidiary and the Administrative Agent agree as follows: Each Borrowing Subsidiary unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as a principal obligor and not merely as a surety, the due and punctual
payment and performance of all Obligations of Alcoa (the  Guaranteed Obligations ). Each Borrowing Subsidiary further agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further
assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon the provisions of this Subsidiary Guarantee notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Guaranteed Obligation. Each Borrowing Subsidiary waives presentation to, demand of payment from and protest to any Borrower of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and
also waives notice of acceptance of the guarantee set forth herein and notice of protest for nonpayment. No obligations of any Borrowing Subsidiary hereunder shall be affected by (i) the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to
assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Borrower under the provisions of the Credit Agreement, this Subsidiary Guarantee or any other guarantee; (ii) any extension or renewal of any provision of the Credit
Agreement, this Subsidiary Guarantee or any other guarantee; or (iii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of the Credit Agreement, this Subsidiary Guarantee or any other guarantee or any other
agreement. Each Borrowing Subsidiary further agrees that the guarantee set forth herein constitutes a guarantee of payment when due and
not of collection and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to the balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Administrative Agent or the relevant Lender, as applicable, in
favor of any Borrower or any other person. F-1 The obligations of each Borrowing Subsidiary hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction,
limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim or waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Borrowing Subsidiary hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected
by the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under the Credit Agreement, this Subsidiary Guarantee, by any waiver or modification of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay,
willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Guaranteed Obligations or by any other act or omission which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Borrowing Subsidiary or would otherwise operate as a discharge of such
Borrowing Subsidiary as a matter of law or equity (other than the defense of payment in satisfaction of such Obligation). Each Borrowing
Subsidiary further agrees that this guarantee shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment by any Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest on
such Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any holder of any Guaranteed Obligation upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of Alcoa or otherwise. In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have at law or in
equity against any Borrowing Subsidiary by virtue hereof, upon the failure of Alcoa to pay any Guaranteed Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Borrowing
Subsidiary hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Administrative Agent, promptly pay, or cause to be paid, to such Agent in cash the amount of such unpaid Guaranteed Obligation, and thereupon such Agent shall assign, in
any reasonable manner, the amount of the Guaranteed Obligation paid by such Borrowing Subsidiary pursuant to this Subsidiary Guarantee, such assignment to be pro tanto to the extent to which the Guaranteed Obligation in question was
discharged by such Borrowing Subsidiary, or make such other disposition thereof as such Borrowing Subsidiary shall direct (all without recourse to the Administrative Agent or any Lender and without any representation or warranty by the
Administrative Agent or Lender). Upon payment by any Borrowing Subsidiary of any sums to the Administrative Agent as provided above, all
rights of such Borrowing Subsidiary against Alcoa arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full of all the
Guaranteed Obligations. Each Borrowing Subsidiary hereby makes and agrees to be bound by all the representations, warranties and
agreements set forth in Articles III, V and VI of the Credit Agreement. This Subsidiary Guarantee shall be binding upon, and inure to the
benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. This Subsidiary Guarantee may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which, when taken together, shall constitute but
one instrument. THIS SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEE SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK. Anything contained in this Subsidiary Guarantee to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of each Borrowing
Subsidiary hereunder shall be limited to a maximum aggregate amount equal to the greatest amount that would not render such Borrowing Subsidiarys obligations hereunder subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under
Section 548 of Title 11 of the United States Code or any provisions of applicable state, federal or provincial law (collectively, the  Fraudulent Transfer Laws ), in each case after giving effect to all other liabilities of
such Borrowing Subsidiary, contingent or otherwise, that are relevant under the Fraudulent Transfer Laws and after giving effect to the value of any rights to subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar rights of such Borrowing
Subsidiary. In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Subsidiary Guarantee should be held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, none of the parties hereto shall be required to comply with such provision for so long as such provision is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, but the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions contained herein and in the Credit Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired. The parties hereto shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the
economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions. All communications and
notices hereunder shall be in writing and given as provided in Section 10.01 of the Credit Agreement. [Signature page follows] IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Subsidiary Guarantee to be executed by their respective
officers thereunto duly authorized. [                    ], as Borrowing Subsidiary By: Name: Title: A CCEPTED AND A GREED as of the date first written above: CITIBANK, N.A., as Administrative

This program is part of the Surface Mining Reclamation Act of 1977. Reclaiming the land with federal money has
produced a net increase in the market value of the land. Consequently, as part of the Texas Abandoned Mine Lands program, the Railroad Commission of Texas (RCT) has placed a lien on this property for $411,801. This lien is a fixed amount and is
payable only upon sale of the subject property. The lien does not alter Alcoas right to lease or make other use of this land prior to its sale. In the past 24 months, RCT has applied AML funding to reclaim an additional 240 AML acres. As a
result of a 2011 AML project on 90 acres of Alcoa Sandow Mine land, in September of 2013 RCT assessed an additional lien amount of $135,000. This brings the total lien amount to $546,801 on a total of 1,288 acres of Rockdale Energy Sandow Mine
property. Prior to closing of a sale, Alcoa will need to clear the lien amount with the RCT.
